# simple-modern-poetry

## What is This?

**simple-modern-poetry** is a minimal, modern **Python project template** for new
projects (Python 3.10–3.13) that uses
[**Poetry 2.0**](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
This template aims to be a good base for serious work but also simple so it's an easy
option for any small project.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> See [simple-modern-uv](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv) for a similar but
> template for **uv**, which is newer and may be best for new projects.

It is still surprisingly hard to learn modern best practices for setting up Python
installations and tools without reading many pages of docs on
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) (and its
[2.0 update](https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-2.0.0/)),
[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx),
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) etc.

So I'm sharing a template that I now use myself and that I can point friends to.

It aims to be "done right" with modern tools but still absolutely as simple as possible:

- Modern [**Poetry**](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) setup with
  [dynamic versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) to make
  releases easier along with the
  [shell](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell) and
  [up](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/poetry-plugin-up) plugins.
  (Why use Poetry? See [below](#alternatives).)

- Simple **GitHub Actions CI workflow** including (optional) **publishing to PyPI**. To
  publish a release, just create a release on GitHub.

- Standard, modern linting, formatting, and testing with
  [**black**](https://github.com/psf/black),
  [**ruff**](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff),
  [**usort**](https://github.com/facebook/usort),
  [**mypy**](https://github.com/python/mypy),
  [**codespell**](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell), and
  [**pytest**](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).

- A **starter readme** with handy reminders on Python and Poetry setup/installation and
  basic dev workflows using to save time for you and users or collaborators.

- The whole template is **only ~300 lines of code** so you can read it and change what
  you want.

It doesn't have lots of options or try to use every bell and whistle.
It just adds the above essential things that should be in place for any new Python
project.

## When to Use This Template

It should work whenever you want to use modern Python and Poetry and have a build
workflow in GitHub. It does not handle:

- Using Docker (but you could add this later)

- Using [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) for dependencies (but note many deep
  learning libraries like PyTorch now support pip so this isn't as necessary as often as
  it used to be)

- Using a code repo or build system that isn't GitHub and GitHub Actions

(See [below](#alternatives) for other options.)

## How to Use This Template

> [!NOTE]
> 
> By default this template uses MIT license.
> If you want a different license or are not publishing your project as open source,
> update `license` in pyproject.yaml and the LICENSE file.
> If desired, you may delete the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file if you are not
> publishing to PyPI.

The template can be used in two ways.
Option 1 is quickest.
For more flexibility, consider Option 2.

### Option 1: GitHub Template

Just use
[**this template repository**](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-poetry-template),
which is the output of this template.

Go there and hit the "Use this template" button.
Once you have the code, search for **`_changeme_`** for all field names like project
name, author, etc. You may also want to change the license/copyright.

### Option 2: Use Copier

This template uses [**copier**](https://github.com/copier-org/copier), which seems like
the best tool nowadays for project templates.
Using copier is the recommended approach since it then lets you instantiate the template
variables, but it requires a few more commands.

Note that copier also has the cool feature to [update your project
template](#updating-your-project-template) as this template improves in the future.

To create a new project repo with `copier`:

```shell
# Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and pipx installed. (If not, see below.)

# Install copier:
pipx install copier

# Clone this template:
copier copy gh:jlevy/simple-modern-poetry your-project-name
# Then follow the instructions.
```

You can enter names for the project, description, etc., or just press enter and later
look for `_changeme_` in the code.

Once you have the template set up, you will need to check the code into Git for Poetry
to work. [Create a new GitHub
repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
and add your initial code:

```shell
cd PROJECT
git init
# Make license or other initial adjustments if needed.
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from simple-modern-poetry."
# Create repo on GitHub.
git remote add origin git@github.com:OWNER/PROJECT.git  # or https://github.com/...
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Getting Started on Your Project

The
[**default template readme**](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-poetry-template)
covers the install and build workflows.
It's just Poetry and a tiny Makefile with shortcuts.
It also has concise documentation on installing Python and Poetry.

## Updating Your Project Template

If you use Option 2 or if you pick Option 1 and correctly fill in your
`.copier-answers.yml` file, you have the option to update your project with any future
updates to this template at any time.

If this file is updated with your project name etc., then you can
[update your project](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updating/) to reflect any
changes to this template by running `copier update`.

## Alternatives

**Poetry** is one of the best package managers for modern Python projects.
Those who love the latest tools may want to consider
[**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) instead of Poetry.

Or for [**Conda**](https://github.com/conda/conda) dependencies, also consider the newer
[**pixi**](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/) package manager.

Currently (early 2025) Poetry is one of the most mature, straightforward options,
especially since tool support, such as GitHub workflows and dependabot, still seem
better for Poetry.

Assuming you want to use Poetry, there are several other good templates, such as
[cookiecutter-poetry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry) and
[poetry-copier](https://github.com/lukin0110/poetry-copier) you may wish to consider.

This template takes a different philosophy.
I found existing ones to be out of date or have lots of options and scaffolding for
different frameworks.
That's hard to maintain in the template repo and overwhelming to read at first.
This is intended instead to be a very simple base.
You can add to it if you want.
